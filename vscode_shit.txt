Where there are package inport issues:
1. Go into the workspace folder (here _workspaceRootFolder_) and create a `.env` file
2. In this empty `.env` file add the line `PYTHONPATH=codeFolder` (replace _codeFolder_ with your folder name)
3. Add `"python.envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"` to the `settings.json`
4. Restart VS code
