Creating SSH keays on MAC:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

Copy the public key:

pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

To push the public key to the new server:
scp ~/.ssh/google_id_rsa.pub user@server_IP:~/.ssh/authorized_keys

On the server:
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*

To be able to use SSH key for FTP on Ubuntu:
1) Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file: change PasswordAuthentication and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to yes.
2) Create ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
3) Put the public key into authorized_keys


A good practice is to disallow root and password logins (leave only logins with a key). 
To log into Ubuntu server without SSH key:
1) Log as as a root to you Ubuntu server
	vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
1.1) PermitRootLogin no
1.2) If you want to have password access for others, change to: 
- PasswordAuthentication yes

2) Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords
	PasswordAuthentication no

3) Restart SSH:
	service sshd reload

Accessing SSH from remote:
ssh -v user@<IP> 
will give a a verbose run
